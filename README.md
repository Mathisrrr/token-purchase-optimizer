# Token Purchase Optimization ðŸŽ¯

**Academic Project â€“ Algorithmic Optimization (L2-S4)**  

This project aims to **find the optimal way to buy colored tokens** while minimizing the total cost under a set of constraints.  
It was developed as part of a university course on algorithmic problem solving and optimization techniques.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

- Model an optimization problem in Python.  
- Apply and compare different algorithmic approaches such as **greedy algorithms**, **dynamic programming**, and **brute-force strategies**.  
- Implement an **optimal solution** to efficiently solve the problem.  
- Understand trade-offs between computation time and optimality.

## ðŸ§  Implemented Solution

The implemented algorithm provides an **optimal solution** to the token purchase problem.  
The detailed explanation of the reasoning, mathematical formulation, and algorithmic steps can be found in the accompanying **README Word document (in French)**.  
This document presents the theoretical background and the justification of the chosen approach.
